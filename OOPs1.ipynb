    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. It allows the class to control access to its data by providing methods to manipulate the data while hiding the internal implementation details. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and provides data security and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, known as the parent or base class. The class that inherits the properties and behaviors is called the child or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing the child class to inherit and extend the functionality of the parent class. It helps in creating a hierarchical relationship between classes, enabling the creation of specialized classes based on more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or have multiple behaviors. In the context of OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables methods to be defined in the base class and overridden in the derived classes, allowing different implementations of the same method based on the specific class instance. Polymorphism promotes flexibility and extensibility in software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the concept of representing complex real-world entities as simplified models within the program. It involves focusing on essential features while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction allows programmers to create abstract classes and interfaces that define a common set of methods without providing the implementation details. It enables the separation of the interface from the implementation, making code more modular and easier to maintain. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and enhancing code readability and usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP provide a foundation for designing and implementing modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems. They facilitate code organization, promote code reuse, and improve overall software quality."

    "2. Invoking instance methods: `self` is required to invoke other instance methods within a class. When calling a method on an object, `self` ensures that the method is called on the specific instance, allowing access to its attributes and performing operations related to that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Differentiating between instance and local variables: `self` helps to distinguish between instance variables and local variables with the same name within a method. It ensures that you're referring to the instance attributes when using `self.attribute_name` instead of a local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enabling method chaining: By returning `self` at the end of a method, you can enable method chaining. Method chaining allows multiple method calls to be chained together in a single line, enhancing code readability and conciseness.\n",

The class that inherits from another class is called the derived class or subclass, and the class being inherited from is called the base class, parent class, or superclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and the creation of specialized classes based on more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of inheritance relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class inherits properties and behaviors from a single base class. It forms a one-to-one inheritance relationship. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal is eating...\")\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance allows a derived class to inherit properties and behaviors from multiple base classes. It forms a one-to-many inheritance relationship. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Flyable:\n",

    "        print(\"Flying...\")\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",

    "sports_car.accelerate()  # Defined method in SportsCar class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `SportsCar` class inherits from the `Car` class, which itself inherits from the `Vehicle` class. The `SportsCar` class inherits the `start()` method from the `Vehicle` class and the `drive()` method from the `Car` class, while also defining its own `accelerate()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Hierarchical inheritance involves multiple derived classes inheriting from a single base class. It forms a one-to-many inheritance relationship. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def draw(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Drawing shape...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both the `Circle` and `Square` classes inherit from the `Shape` class. Each derived class overrides the `draw()` method of the `Shape` class with its own implementation.\n",
