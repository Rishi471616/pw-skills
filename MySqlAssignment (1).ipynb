    "A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, storage, and manipulation of that data. It serves as a central repository for various types of information used by software applications.\n",

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two main categories of database management systems, each with its own characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL Databases:\n",
    "   - SQL databases are relational databases that use a structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "   - They have a predefined schema, meaning the structure of the data must be defined before adding data.\n",
    "   - SQL databases are best suited for applications requiring complex queries and transactions, such as banking systems or accounting software.\n",
    "   - Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not require a fixed schema, allowing for more flexibility in handling unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "   - They can handle large volumes of data and are designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers.\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases are often used in big data and real-time web applications, where high scalability and performance are crucial.\n",
    "   - Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis.\n",

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and modifying the structure of database objects. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE**: The `CREATE` statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or procedures. It specifies the structure of the object being created and any initial settings or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a table named `users` with columns for `id`, `username`, and `email`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       username VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP**: The `DROP` statement is used to delete existing database objects. It removes the specified object and all its associated data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping the table named `users`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE users;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER**: The `ALTER` statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns, constraints, or indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Adding a new column `age` to the `users` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE users\n",
    "   ADD COLUMN age INT;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE**: The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to remove all rows from a table, but it does not delete the table itself. It is faster than the `DELETE` statement because it does not generate individual row deletion logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the `users` table:\n",

In the case of queries that involve placeholders (e.g., for inserting data), the method can also take a tuple of values to be inserted into the placeholders. After executing an SQL command, any changes made to the database need to be committed using the `commit()` method on the database connection object.\n",

    "In the provided example, we create a table named `employees` using the `execute()` method, insert data into the table, retrieve data from the table, and finally close the cursor and the database connection."
